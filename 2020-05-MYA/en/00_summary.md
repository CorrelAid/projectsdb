CorrelAid volunteers support the [MyAiGuide](www.myaiguide.org) project that aims to create personal AI-based health coaches for people with chronic pain. The project uses time-series data from fitness and health trackers of participants that experience chronic pain. In the first step so far, the CorrelAid project team has successfully worked on cleaning and standardizing the data. In the next steps, they'll look into correlations between physical health / chronic pain and mental health of the participants and start building individualized AI models that will help participants decide when / how to exercise to ease their chronic pain.
