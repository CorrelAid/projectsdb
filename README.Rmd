This repository contains the temporary "database" of CorrelAid projects for which a [thorough follow-up](https://docs.correlaid.org/project-manual/project-team/what-you-do#follow-up) was done. 
The data in this repository is used to present the projects [on our website](https://correlaid.org/projects). More specifically, the website pulls data from `projects.json`.

# Important concepts 
## Project ID
Each CorrelAid project has a project ID. It has three components:

- **Three-letter, uppercase** identifier for the organization. Usually the first three letters of the organization's name, unless it has a three-letter acronym (e.g in the case of the European Youth Parliament, we use EYP)
- Year in which the project started.
- Month in which the project started. 

There are *two versions* of the project id:

- {identifier}-{month}-{year}: this version is used in surveymonkey questionnaries
- {year}-{month}-{identifier}: this version is used in the CorrelCloud and on GitHub because sorting by year is more meaningful. 

# Utility R Package

An utility R package `{projectutils}` :package: is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/CorrelAid/projectutils).

Install it with the `{devtools}` :package:
```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("CorrelAid/projectutils")
```

or with the `{remotes}` :package: 
```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("CorrelAid/projectutils")
```

# How to contribute
Are you part of a project team and currently working on the follow up for your project? Great!

## Create a branch
Clone the repository if you have not already. On your machine, create a branch for your project with its ID as branch name, e.g. on the command line: 
```bash
git checkout -b FOO-10-2020
```

## Create new project folder

### with `{projectutils}` :package:

```{r}
library(projectutils)
new_project(prefix = "FOO", year = 2020, month = 10)
```
This will create a folder `2020-10-FOO` with all the files that need to be filled out.

### Without `{projectutils}`
Copy the example folder `0000-00-EXA` and rename it so that it reflects your project ID.

## Edit the files

Creating / copying the folder will give you the following folder scaffold for your project: 

```{r}
fs::dir_tree("2020-10-FOO")
```

As mentioned in the [CodiMD template](https://pad.correlaid.org/lTV3NzFNRxGK3wrcSYIk4Q), you only have to create content in either German or English. Fill in the files that correspond to the four main sections of the template into `01_problem.md` until `04_impact.md`. In addition, there are two files: 

- `00_about.md`: here you should fill in the description of the organization. You can copy this from their website (in this case, please specify the source in `meta.json`). 
- `00_summary.md`: this is a three-sentence summary of the project.

The final file is `meta.json`. It is a json file where you can add various meta information about the project. If the descriptions in the json are not sufficient to understand what is required, please ask Frie. 

To edit the markdown and JSON files, you should use a text editor with decent json and markdown support. RStudio and Python IDEs like PyCharm should be sufficient to do this. If you want to explore some other, more general options, you can check out the following, more general-purpose text editors / IDEs: 

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)


### `{projectutils}` helpers
As an alternative to directly editing the `meta.json` file, you can use R and `{projectutils}` to help you with the editing process. 

You can load a project:
```{r}
proj <- load_project("2020-10-FOO")
```
You can then use typical list operations such as:

```{r}
proj$end <- "2010-10"
proj$repo$public <- TRUE # if the project repository is public 
proj$links$en <- list() # no links in english 
proj$links$de <- list("Deutschsprachig CorrelAid [here](https://correlaid.org)") 
proj$team <- list(
  list(first_name = "Alex", last_name = "Test", github = "data4gooder"), 
  list(first_name = "Rock", last_name = "Stone", twitter = "twitterer", website = "https://mywebsite.com")
  )
proj$published <- TRUE # set to true always before making a PR.
```

For _top-level_ fields, there is also `update_project` (experimental):
```{r}
proj <- update_project(proj, "start", "2020-04")
```

Once you are finished with editing your project in R, update `meta.json` by: 
```{r}
write_project(proj)
```


```{r include=FALSE}
unlink("2020-10-FOO", recursive = TRUE)
```

## Push and PR
Collaborate with your project team mates on the branch. Once you are ready, open a PR. 


# Misc: Load and update all projects
To load all projects in R:

```{r}
all_projects <- load_projects()
```


This loads all projects and then updates `projects.json` which contains all projects.
```{r}
library(magrittr)
update_projects_json()
```
