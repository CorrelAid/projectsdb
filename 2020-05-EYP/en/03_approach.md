The CorrelAid project team was asked to help the EYP team gaining new insights into the structure and background of the participants in the EYP events. The aim was to show in the evaluation the development of different items, such as attitudes of participants, before and after the event. 
For this purpose, the surveys have been evaluated with R. Mean values of the evaluations were estimated and presented in diagrams. The diagrams compared the mean values for the corresponding items in the first and second survey. This made a direct comparison possible, which should give the organisation an idea of the impact of the event on the participantsâ€™ evaluation of the items. 
Note that no causal identification strategy was implemented, thus causal interpretations are not warranted. Due to the data structure, no statistical statements about the development can be made which would allow for an incontestable interpretation of the results. Nevertheless, a difference in the data between the pre- and post-survey could be shown and thus help the client in the evaluation of the results. The results of the data analysis together with advice for simplifying and standardising the surveys were summarised in a report, explained and handed over to the EYP team in a video conference.
