The CorrelAid project team helped the EYP team gaining new insights into the structure and background of the participants in the EYP events.
The aim was to show the development of different items, such as attitudes of participants, before and after the event. This was achieved by estimating the mean values and presenting them in diagrams. This made a direct comparison possible, which should give the organisation an idea of the impact of the event on the participantsâ€™ evaluation of the items. Note that causal interpretations are not warranted given to the data structure. The surveys were evaluated with R.
