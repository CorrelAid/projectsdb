The European Youth Parliament conducted three surveys at events in five different cities. These were a preliminary survey, a survey immediately after the event and a survey three months after the event. The “Active Volunteers” (volunteers who also participate in the event, but from the EYP side) were interviewed during the event and also three months after the event. The number of respondents varied between approximately 20 and 130, depending on the city and type of survey. The number of questions also varied between 26 and over 150, depending on the city and type of survey.
