The aim of the project was to present the data from the surveys to give the European Youth Parliament an more detailed picture of who participates in their event and to highlight the effect of the EYP events on the attitudes and skills of the participants. In addition, the work with the data was to be used to make a recommendation on how the European Youth Parliament could carry out independent analyses in the future and what improvements it could seek in the design and implementation of the survey.
