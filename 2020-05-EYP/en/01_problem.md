The aim of the project was to clearly present the data from the surveys and to give the European Youth Parliament an overview of the structure of participants and to highlight the effect of the EYP events on the attitudes and skills of the participants. In addition, the work with the data was to be used to make a recommendation on how the European Youth Parliament could carry out independent analyses in the future or what improvements it could seek in the design and implementation of the survey.
