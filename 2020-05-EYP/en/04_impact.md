As the main result a report was handed over to the EYP. The used methods were explained, surprising results were discussed and possible explanatory factors were added. Furthermore, the report contains suggestions for improvement of the data collection or the survey in order to achieve clearer results in the future. Due to the structure of the data, extensive code was used to clean the data, which the EYP is unlikely to be able to use if there is no knowledge of R. However, the CorrelAid project team's report revealed weaknesses in the contentual and technical design of the surveys.
The EYP was able to see that the events carried out were generally very positively evaluated by the participants. During the project, it became clear where changes in the survey are needed in order to simplify processes and shorten the project duration without sacrificing quality.
