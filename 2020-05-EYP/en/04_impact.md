The results of the data analysis were summarised in a report that was handed over to the EYP in a joint video conference. The used methods were explained, results were discussed and additional factors of interest were added afterwards.
The report contains suggestions for improvement of the data collection and survey in order to achieve results that are more reliable in the future. The team recommended to make the surveys more consistent, e.g. by using the same set of questions across the events, to make sure that results are comparable and to make future anlyses easier.
The EYP has learned from the analysis that the events carried out were generally very positively evaluated by the participants. A difference in the pre- and post-event means was observed for some items of interest.
