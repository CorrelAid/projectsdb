The effects are twofold: First, the survey results indicated that there is a large interest among all that were surveyed, both among the population as well as the relevant stakeholders. This result not only gives all members of the Denk-Mal-Kultur steering committee for the "academy" and the practical research center a confidence boost but also makes it easier to approach ministries and other potential sponsers in fundraising. 


Second, the survey results make it easier for the steering committee to rank activities by interest and potential support of local stakeholders. In short, it provides a solid, user-oriented foundation for future activities that are aimed at setting up the *academy for self-determined aging* and the practical research center.
