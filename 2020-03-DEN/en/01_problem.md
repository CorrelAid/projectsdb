Denk-mal-Kultur e.V. primarily cares for the Heinersdorf Manor. Together with partners, Denk-mal-Kultur e.V. would like to establish an *academy for self-determined aging*. In this context, a practical research center tackling the question: „How can one best manage growing older in rural areas?“ should be established as well. When Denk-Mal-Kultur contacted CorrelAid, they were at the very beginning of scoping the project and asked for support in finding out whether the local population and potential stakeholders (politics, administration, care givers and medical staff) were interested in the endeavour of creating a practical research center. They had a rough survey draft but were seeking help in making it more precise, setting up an online survey, and analyzing the results to get actionable insights for the initiative  that could help in further activities, e.g. contacting potential project partners or pursuing fundraising opportunities.
