The association Denk-mal-Kultur e.V. [...] aims to continue to organize cultural highlights, but has also set itself the goal of preserving Heinersdorf's historic village center and actively supporting the restoration of the church and the manor house. The association is primarily committed to the church and manor house Heinersdorf and wants to continue to offer cultural events there. Denk-mal-Kultur e.V. thus takes care of monuments and culture in a broader sense. At the moment, however, we are primarily concerned with the Heinersdorf Manor House project.
