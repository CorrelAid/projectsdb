CorrelAid supported in improving the survey design by designing not only the key questions with regards to the research center but also demographical questions such as gender and education. CorrelAid then implemented the online survey using [SoGo](https://www.sogosurvey.com/). About 140 citizens as well as relevant stakeholders answered the survey. 


Using the demographical data, the CorrelAid team was able to check whether there were differences across different potential users or stakeholders. In addition, the team used those demographics to evaluate the representativeness of the survey data: to do so, the team compared some of the characteristics (e.g. gender and education) to the offical statistics of the region. 


The CorrelAid Team prepared a PDF report with many useful graphs and their interpretations. The analysis identified relevant interest groups, topics, communication channels, and forms of interaction. Among other results, it showed that the practical research center sparks more interest among women.
