Our support for erlassjahr has two main impacts. First, we helped the team to focus their time and efforts on in-depth research on states' debt levels by replacing manual copy-paste work with automated data generation processes. Second, we implemented an [interactive world map](https://erlassjahr.de/informieren/karte-ueberschuldete-staaten-weltweit/) that complements the static annual report. As a result, it is now possible for users to interactively explore the results in the annual report by selecting different categories and filtering a variety of parameters. This makes the interactive world map more accessible and perceptible for a larger group of users.
