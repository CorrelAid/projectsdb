The German jubilee network **„erlassjahr.de / Jubilee Germany“** wants to achieve that more importance is attached to the living conditions of people in indebted countries than to the servicing of sovereign debt. At present, Jubilee Germany is supported by over 600 organisations out of church, politics and civil society throughout Germany and is involved in a worldwide network of national and regional jubilee initiatives.
