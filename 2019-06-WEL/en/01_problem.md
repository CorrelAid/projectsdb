The Weltladen Umbrella Association (de: Weltladen Dachverband) and the Eine Welt Netzwerk Bayern (in the following only Weltladen Umbrella Association) conduct surveys of their members - individual World Shops - every year in order to better understand their situation and needs. The members are also to be given useful feedback regarding their position in comparison to the other members / shops.

The purpose of the survey is to provide individualized feedback to each World Shop that participates in the survey. The report contains various plots and descriptive statistics that allow each Weltladen to assess its situation in comparison to other shops. Before the CorrelAid project, the individual reports had been created manually with Excel and Word. With several hundred participating members, this was a very time-consuming and error-prone process, which was difficult to manage by the mostly volunteer staff of the Weltladen Umbrella Association.

Hence, the Weltladen Umbrella Association wanted to automate this process. Furthermore, statistical analyses were conducted to reveal additional correlations in the structure amongst the members of the Weltladen Umbrella Association.
