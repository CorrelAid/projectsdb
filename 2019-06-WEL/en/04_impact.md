Thanks to the automation approach, the Weltladen Umbrella Association can now create reports more easily, on a more regular basis and with much less effort. The validity of the data has also been improved.

In addition, the project has given the Weltladen Umbrella Association a better understanding of the general approach to data-driven processes and decision making. For example, the staff now knows that when designing surveys they need to consider the potential impact of design decisions on the quality and analysis of the data. Finally, the Weltladen Assocation was introduced to the tools  used and their possibilities.

On the other side, the CorrelAid volunteers were able to gain a better understanding of the needs and internal workings of NGOs in general and the World Shops in particular. The project also allowed them to learn a lot from each other, both with regards to tools and collaboration.
