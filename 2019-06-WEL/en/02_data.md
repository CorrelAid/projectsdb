The data was based on an online survey of the individual World Shops. The data set included a several hundred  participating shops and several dozens of variables.

The data was exported from the online survey tool as .csv files and made available to the CorrelAid team.  During the project, the data was stored exclusively on the Weltladen Assocation's systems and CorrelAid servers to prevent unauthorised access.
