At the start of the project, TV KÃ¤fertal was at the beginning of an extensive evaluation. On the one hand, the club's management wanted to get a picture of member satisfaction with regard to the sporting aspects of the club, on the other had, to scrutinize its own communication and its effectiveness. It was particularly important to distinguish between the needs of regular members and those of the club's volunteers. For this reason, the club management planned to conduct a comprehensive member survey at the beginning of 2019.
