In collaboration with the association's management, the key topics and questions for the member survey were defined at the end of 2018. Thanks to the social science expertise of the CorrelAid team, an online survey tool was selected and a meaningful set of questions, including response options, was designed. Extensive testing ensured that members were directed to the questions that were important to their role in the association. Due to the age structure within the association, particular attention was paid to ease of understanding and use of the questionnaire.

After a successful field phase of the survey, the team was faced with the task of illustrating the survey data in an understandable way. Statistical analyses were used to summarize and visualize the data. In early summer 2019, the results could be handed over to the association in an almost 30-page report.
