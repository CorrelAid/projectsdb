In order to obtain as comprehensive an opinion as possible, a digital survey was used. This required the creation of an online survey in which members could provide meaningful responses to relevant questions. Additionally, the design of the survey required that members and volunteers in all their roles were guided to the questions designed for them.

After more than150 members of TV KÃ¤fertal had participated in the survey, the CorrelAid team began to analyze, visualize, and describe the results in the context of the survey.

The (anonymized) member data from the club's card index also helped to draw a clear picture of the socio-demographic structure of the members.
